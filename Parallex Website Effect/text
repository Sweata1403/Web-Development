#The difference between HTML images <img> and CSS background images. 
The HTML <img> element is for images that are part of the content, while CSS background images are purely decorative.

An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element 
will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted 
to fit into any gap left by the element. */
